## Pulse → Ads Analytics Relevance

This project demonstrates Analytics Engineering skills directly applicable to Netflix Ads:

- Designed a database schema that captures **event-level user sentiment interactions**, similar to ad-platform telemetry (impressions, clicks, reactions)
- Built transformations that prepare data in a **dimensional, ML-ready format** for ranking and recommendation models
- Implemented ELT-style thinking: raw inputs → cleaned interaction logs → analytics-friendly outputs
- Created real-time metrics endpoints comparable to monitoring an ads marketplace
- Deployed the application with fully **environment-driven configuration**, mirroring production data-pipeline best practices
- Engineered auditable user × item × sentiment × timestamp records, reflecting how Ads teams model user behavior for targeting and performance analysis
